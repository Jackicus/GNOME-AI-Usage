# The providers: where the numbers come from

## Claude

`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the OAuth access token from
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` — the
request Claude Code's own `/usage` makes, so the button and the terminal agree.
The header is not currently required; it is sent to look exactly like the tool.

The useful part is `limits[]`: one row per limit with `percent`, `severity`,
`resets_at` and `scope.model` on per-model rows; an unknown `kind` is shown under a
label made from its name. The older top-level `five_hour`/`seven_day` fields are not
read. `seven_day_breakdown` says where the week went;
`extra_usage`/`spend` are paid credits — when disabled, a `percent: null` credits
entry drawn as an "Extra usage · off" line with no bar.

**The plan name** is not in that response, and it is *not* the credentials'
`rateLimitTier` — that is stamped at sign-in and never rewritten, so an upgraded
account reports its old plan. It comes from `~/.claude.json` →
`oauthAccount.organizationRateLimitTier` (then `userRateLimitTier`), which Claude
Code refreshes on start: a second file read, not a second request. Only the tier
is taken from that file. Absent or unreadable falls back to the credentials tier,
then `subscriptionType` — a missing plan name is fine, a wrong one is not.

**The endpoint is undocumented and its shape moves** — it carries codenamed
fields (`iguana_necktie`, `nimbus_quill`, …), which are never touched. Parsers
read defensively and return `Status.UNAVAILABLE` rather than throw or show a
wrong number.

## Antigravity

`agy` keeps its login in the **secret service**; the file
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` is only written without a
D-Bus session and is stale on a desktop, so the keyring is tried first. Two
POSTs to `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`: `loadCodeAssist` (project id, kept until
a token is rejected or the extension is disabled: the app reads through a copy
of each provider made per enable) then `retrieveUserQuotaSummary`.

* **Its access token lasts an hour** (`token.expiry`, written with nanoseconds),
  and `agy` writes a fresh one only as it starts: an hour after `agy` was last
  started the stored login has lapsed, and the tab says when. A token past its
  expiry is reported without a request. The keyring cannot be watched as a file,
  so the app subscribes to the secret service's `Collection` signals (a rewritten
  item is announced as `ItemCreated`) and reads again when `agy` writes it.
* **The token is not refreshed here**, though Google's refresh, unlike
  Anthropic's, is not known to rotate the refresh token: it needs `agy`'s OAuth
  client id and secret, which are not ours to ship, and whether it rotates has
  not been confirmed against the live endpoint (#29).
* It answers **403** to a User-Agent not starting `antigravity`, which is why
  `Http` sets no session-wide agent and each provider passes its own.
* **The plan is `paidTier.name`** ("Google AI Pro") in the `loadCodeAssist`
  answer. `currentTier` stays `free-tier` on a subscription and its `name` is only
  "Antigravity", so it is the fallback, humanised. Seen on a live Pro account on
  2026-10-04; the plan is asked for with the project, so it is kept as long as that is.
* **The response says what is LEFT**; everything else here shows USED. Its own
  "Weekly Limit Remaining" label would lie over the inverted figure, so labels
  are built from window and model family. A parser check pins 0, 1 and 0.35.

## Codex

`GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with the access token and
`ChatGPT-Account-ID` from `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` (default `~/.codex/`), as
Codex's `/status` does. Verified on a free-plan account (codex-cli 0.160.0,
2026-10-02): its only window is 30 days (`primary_window`, `This month`),
`secondary_window` and `additional_rate_limits` are null. The 5-hour and weekly
windows of the paid plans are known only from openai/codex's source
(`codex-usage.json`). Windows carry no name and are told apart by
`limit_window_seconds`. The response also carries the account's `email`,
`user_id` and `account_id`, which are never read; `chatpass` and
`code_review_rate_limit` are not shown.

## Renewing an expired login

`renew-login` runs `timeout 60 <cli> <renewArgs>` once per expiry (reset by the
next good read) and does not wait: the credentials file monitor reads the result.
`renewArgs` is `['doctor']` for Claude and Codex, found by pointing each CLI at a mock
token server with fake logins (a real refresh would rotate Claude's token): Claude Code
2.1.288 and codex-cli 0.156.0, 2026-10-03. `claude doctor` and `claude mcp list` refresh
and rewrite the file with no model call (`mcp list` also starts the user's MCP
servers); `claude auth status` posts the refresh but exits before saving it;
`codex doctor` refreshes, while `codex login status` and `codex mcp list` do not.
`agy models` never asked the token endpoint, so Antigravity has none (#29).
Re-run that probe before changing a command or after a CLI major version.

## Adding a provider

1. Find the request the CLI makes for its own usage command (`strings` over the
   binary, grepped for `usage`/`limit`, is how `/api/oauth/usage` was found),
   and where the tool stores its login.
2. Write `src/lib/providers/<id>.js` mapping the response onto `Limit`s, using
   `common.js` (Readings, login files, labels, timestamps, failures) and
   `stringOrNull`/`numberOrNull` from `usage.js` for outside data.
   The provider is an object: `id` (the settings path and its tab),
   `displayName`, `cli` (looked for on `PATH`) and `cliName` (named in the
   sign-in message), `capabilities` (which of `perModel`, `breakdown`, `credits` it can honour),
   `renewArgs` (optional: the CLI's arguments that make it refresh its own login,
   below), `keyring` (true when it reads the secret service, which the app then
   watches), `credentialsFile()` (watched, so the tool's refresh is read at once) and
   `read(http, cancellable)`, resolving to a `Reading`, the login read afresh
   each call. Contract: never throw (return a `Reading` with a `Status`; only a
   cancellation, which `failureReading()` throws on, goes up), never write to the
   provider's files, never log in, and pull nothing of St, Clutter or Soup into
   the prefs process — read `e.status` duck-typed, as `failureReading()` does.
   `make imports` enforces the last.
3. Register it in `registry.js`; preferences, settings and `make providers`
   follow. Add a fixture under `tests/fixtures/` and checks in `scripts/parsers.js`.
