# How long to let the readings settle before photographing the top bar. Every
# provider is polled at once, and the slowest one sets this: Antigravity keeps
# its login in the secret service, a throwaway bus has none, and the lookup ends
# in a D-Bus activation timeout about 25 seconds later, after which it falls
# back to the stand-in token file. Until it does, the button has no figure for
# Antigravity, and its percentage can change when that one arrives.

# Where to click, on a 1600x900 monitor with the button where it goes by
# default (the right-hand end, nearest the middle). Measured, because the shell
# offers no way to ask an actor where it is: take a `shot` and look. Measured
# *while the driver holds its input session*, which is the only state a click
# ever happens in -- that session is a screencast, the shell puts a recording
# indicator in the top bar for it, and everything to the indicator's left shifts
# along. The indicator is gone from the pictures, because a screenshot is taken
# by a later run of the driver (a later 'do'), after the one that clicked has
# exited.
#
# Anything that changes how wide the button is moves this: the stylesheet's panel
# padding, how many digits the figure has, the font. A stale
# coordinate does not fail -- it clicks the bar, nothing opens, and the pop-up
# picture is of the wallpaper. Re-measure with 'start --stand-in --headless' and
# a 'do "click 1368 16" "shot FILE 0 0 1600 36"'.
